For college graduates, the IQR is relatively smaller, ranging from 23 to 32, suggesting a more concentrated distribution of BMI values. On the other hand, non-college graduates have a wider IQR, ranging from 26 to 36, indicating a greater variability in BMI.\n",

    "> The histogram reveals that the BMI distribution for both college graduates and non-college graduates in women aged 30-40 is right-skewed. The majority of college graduates have BMI values concentrated between 20 and 30, whereas non-college graduates exhibit a higher concentration between 25 and 35. This suggests that the most frequent BMI values differ between the two groups.\n",
